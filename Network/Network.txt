- How to find the peer of a veth?
  ip netns exec netns1 ethtool -S veth1
  output will show peer_ifindex: 5
  enumerate the namespaces to find eth of index 5
  e.g., ip netns exec netns2 ip link | grep 5

- wget from master to a pod (not in master). tunnel mechanism is Ip-in-Ip.

- Route to service

  with nodePort, service can be accessed from machines not in the cluster
   it can be accessed from any nodes in the cluster, e.g. http://<physical_ip_of_any_nodes>:<nodePort>/
  without nodePort, it can only be accessed within the cluster including any nodes or containers.
   it can be accessed from any of cluster_ip:port, container_ip:target_port and node_ip:node_port.
   the behavior is different. try to figure it out.
  
   container in nodeB
   nodeA                           nodeA_ip
   nodeB                           nodeB_ip
   exec container in nodeA         svc_ip
   exec container in nodeB         container_ip
  
  if I open nodeA_ip:nodeA_port, on nodeA I can see
    1. tul0: 192.168.1.0 -> 192.168.1.18:3000 (container_ip:target_port)
    2. enp0s3: clinet <-> nodeA_ip:nodeA_port and other traffic to nodeB is through 6443 and encrypted.
       is the packet forwarding encapsulated in this encrypted connection?
  
  what I observed is iptables redirect the connection (to node or cluster_ip) to pod_ip and let routing 
  table to handle the rest.
